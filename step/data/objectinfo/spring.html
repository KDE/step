</head>
<body>
	<p>A flexible elastic object to store mechanical energy. It has a unique name and the following parameters:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>rest length:</b> is the length of the spring as it is not compressed or stretched.</li>
		<li><b>length:</b> is the initial spring length</li>
		<li><b>stiffness:</b> is the level of spring resistance to compression or stretching</li>
		<li><b>damping:</b> is level of spring ability to disperse stored energy, an internal viscosity</li>
		<li><b>body 1 and 2:</b> are the bodies to which the spring is fixed</li>
		<li><b>local position 1 and 2:</b> are the local positions of the spring ends relative to its center in the non-deformed state</li>
		<li><b>position 1 and 2:</b> are the global positions of the spring ends</li>
		<li><b>force:</b> is the force that acts along the spring</li>
	</ul>
