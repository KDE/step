<body>
<p>Coulomb force is a force of interaction between charged particles.</p>
<p><b>Coulomb's law</b></p>
<li>The magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point electric charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of each of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two charges.</li>
<p>For more details, please refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb's_law">Coulomb Force</a>.</p>
