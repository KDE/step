0. Urgent / Important

* Go through all the STEPCORE_META_OBJECT calls and see how they need
  to be changed after the big refactor. 
   + This means actually understanding STEPCORE_META_OBJECT, which seems to be
     undocumented...

1. Bugs / Issues

 * Crashes
    * Crash when adding weightforce in tutorial 4			[arkro]
      https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=331473
 * Soft bodies lose their internal structure if they get crushed.	----


2. StepCore.

* implement compile flags:
  + STEPCORE_WITH_QT
  + STEPCORE_WITH_ERRORS
  + STEPCORE_WITH_NAMEPROP
  + STEPCORE_WITH_GUIPROPS
* unit tests
* movement restrictions (IN PROGRESS)
* collision detection with friction (IN PROGRESS)
* custom properties for bodies, make charge custom property (?)
* correctly handle stiff ODE
* separate position and coordinate (PARTLY DONE)
  (for independent tolerance settings, symplectic solvers)
* multistep solvers
* symplectic and other nice solvers
* implicit solvers (!)
* more collision and constraints solvers
* NullCollisionSolver and NullConstraintsSolver
* create common class for connectiong something to rigid body
* think about 3d

More TODO items for StepCore can be found in
Doxygen-generated documentation and in the source
code (marked as TODO or XXX).

3. Step.
* SVG theming
* saving animation (navigation through time)
* custom scene background (PARTLY DONE)
* KHotNewStuff for sharing experiments
   + Downloading							DONE
   + Upload								----
* Tutorials (series of experiments with explanations)
* define multiple coordinate system and provide an ability
  to translate vector coordinates between them
* viewer (locked) mode: allow to change only
  explicitly selected properties of the experiment
* grid and snapping
* "fixing" a tool for creating several similar objects
* Object Information (Help Widget)
  Subject: Semantics

  While the code is probably valid xhtml, I can't help to notice you might
  want to use the "dl","dd" and "dt" tags instead of just a regular "li"
  embedding a semantically worthless b tag.

  http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dl.asp for more info and an example.
  Next to being more semantically correct, it allows you to style the pages
  better and easier for different kinds of viewing devices since you can
  then select both elements of the definition separately.

More TODO items for Step can be found in the source code
(marked as TODO or XXX).


4. Future ideas

* Create a game based on Step. Original idea by Jason Harris:

  On each level, you were given a goal and a list of equipment that you could
  use to build a machine to achieve the goal.  The equipment could include
  lots of different stuff: balls of various types (tennis, bowling, baseball),
  springs, trampolines, guns, ropes, pulleys, belts, gears, conveyor belts,
  cats, mice, light bulbs, elecric fans, model rockets, TNT, etc.  You would
  place all this stuff on the playing field, press "Go", and see if the
  level's goal was achieved by your machine.  If not, you would modify the
  machine and try again.  It was a lot of fun for a young proto-physicist :)

----------------------------------------------------------------

Overall goal: To make Step a better teaching tool

For details, see the list above.

 * Add missing object types
    + half plane (ground)						[rahulch]
    + rope(?)
 * Add missing physics concepts
    + coefficient of restitution
    + friction
 * Improve user interaction
    + Add timeline
    + Improve selection, moving and resizing of objects.
    + 
 * New concepts
    + Add materials							[ingwa]

 * Step file format version 2.0
    + refactor
       - Item::Color -->  Material
    + Materials
