<body>
	<p>A rigid box with a unique name and the following parameters:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>position:</b> The X/Y position of the center of mass of the box, relative to the center of the <a href="objinfo:World">world</a>.</li>
		<li><b>angle:</b> By how much the box is rotated in positive direction, that is clock-wise.</li>
		<li><b>velocity:</b> The velocity of the center of mass of the box. Unit: meters/second.</li>
		<li><b>angular velocity:</b> How fast the box is spinning in positive direction, that is clock-wise.</li>
		<li><b>mass:</b> Total mass of the box. This influences forces with which the box interacts with other items.</li>
		<li><b>inertia:</b> How difficult it is to change the box's rotation.</li>
		<li><b>momentum:</b> A fundamental quantity in mechanics that is conserved in the absence of external forces. A product of the mass and the velocity.</li>
		<li><b>angular momentum:</b> Measure of the extent to which the box will continue to rotate unless acted upon by an external torque.</li>
		<li><b>kinetic energy:</b> The work needed to accelerate the body of a given mass from rest to its current velocity.</li>
		<li><b>size:</b> Defines width and height of the box.</li>
	</ul>
