1. StepCore.

* unit tests
* movement restrictions
* rigid bodies
* collision detection with friction
* adaptive timestep solvers (almost done)
* global error estimation (requires jacobian ?)
* symplectic and other nice solvers
* molecular dynamics (potentials etc.)
* massive springs
* soft bodies
* fluid and gas simulation
* think about 3d

More TODO items for StepCore can be found in
Doxygen-generated documentation and in the source
code (marked as TODO or XXX).

2. Step.
* undo/redo
* saving animation (navigation through time)
* user-editable notes
* custom scene background
* nice-looking descriptions for all bodies and parameters
  (with references to wikipedia or wikibooks ?)
* configurable simulation-time controllers
* configurable plots and summaries
* KHotNewStuff for sharing experiments
* Tutorials (series of experiments with explanations)
